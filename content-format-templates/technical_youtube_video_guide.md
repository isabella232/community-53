## Technical YouTube(YT) Videos Guide

### Structure

Webiny YT videos have a consistent content structure of the following sections:

- Title
- Introduction
- Goals (Optional)
- Prerequisites
- `1. Do the First Thing`
- `2. Do the Next Thing`
- ...
- n. Doing the Last Thing
- Conclusion

When it comes to the YT video format there are some other sections we will go through below.

### Title

You can follow up on the [Technical Articles Guideline](/community/content-format-templates/technical_articles_guide.md) for more example titles.
- “How to fix...”
- “How to build...”
- “How to [task] with [tool]”
- ...

### Add your Thumbnail Images (Required)

Once you’ve chosen your clear, informative headline, create a nice thumbnail image.

A free site like Canva.com can help you with this process.

Here is an example of our own thumbnails:

### Choose Your Tags (Required)

You can choose as many tags as you need for your YT video. The tags will make it easier for readers to discover your YT videos through search.

The default tags for Webiny are: `Serverless`, `AWS serverless`(optional), `move to serverless`(optional), `Web Development`...

### Introduction

The purpose of the introduction is to motivate the audience by setting expectations, and summarize what the audience will do by following the YT tutorial. 

Try to answer the following questions in your introduction:

- **What is the video tutorial about?** What software is involved, and what does each component do (briefly)?

- **Why should the audience learn this topic?** What are the benefits of using this particular software in this configuration?
What are some practical reasons why the reader should follow this tutorial?

- **What will the audience do or create in this video tutorial?** Are they setting up an API, or an APP and then testing it? Are they building an app and deploying it? Be specific, as this provides the motivation readers need and gets them excited about the topic.

- **What will the audience have accomplished when they’re done?** What new skills will they have? What will they be able to do that they couldn’t do before?

By answering these questions in your introduction, these will also help you design a clear and focused video tutorial, as you’ll align the steps.

Instead of using phrases like **“We will learn how to”**, use phrases like **“you will configure”** or **“you will build”**.

### Prerequisites

The purpose of prerequisites is to spell out exactly what the audience should have or do before they follow the current tutorial.

The format is a bulleted list that the audiece can use as a checklist, and can have access in the video `description`. 

Each bullet point must link to an existing Webiny tutorial that covers the necessary content if one exists. This allows you to rely on existing content known to work instead of starting from scratch.

Common prerequisites bullet points include:

- Software installation and configuration.
- Additional user accounts like GitHub or other services your reader will need.

You can see a good prerequisites example for:

- A Webiny project, follow the [quick start](http://docs.webiny.com/docs/get-started/quick-start).
- Set up Webiny headless cms with React.js framework, by following this guide [Creating an e-library with Headless CMS + React](http://docs.webiny.com/docs/guides/headless-react-tutorial).

Be specific with your prerequisites. A prerequisite without a link to something specific doesn’t give your reader much context. Instead, consider listing specific concepts the reader should know, and provide them with resources that help them get up to speed so they can successfully complete your tutorial.

### Steps in TimeStamp

The Step sections are the parts of your tutorial where you describe what the audience needs to do. A step contains commands, code listings, and files, and provides explanations that not only explain what to do but also why you’re doing it this way.

You can include each step in the YT video `description` with the exact time on the video, so the audience can maneuver quickly. 

If step 1 is in the `03:15` minute, then you can use the time in the description of the video as `03:15` and it will link with that minute on the video.

Procedural tutorials should start each step title with the number of the step, example `1. 03:15 ...`:

> `1. 03:15 Creating an API service`

Focus on the audience. Instead of phrases like **“We will learn”** or  **“I will explain”**, use phrases like **“You will build”** or **“you will create”**.

- End each step with a transition sentence that describes what the reader accomplished and where they are going next. 

### Conclusion, End Screen

The conclusion of your YT video should summarize what the reader has accomplished by following your video tutorial. 

Instead of using phrases like **“we learned how to”**, use phrases like **“you configured”** or **“you built”**.

The conclusion should also describe what the reader can do next, by including links in the **end screen** of the video.

This can include a description of use cases or features the reader can explore, link to other Webiny tutorials with additional setup or configuration, and external documentation.
