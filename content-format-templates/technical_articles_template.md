### Deep technical articles template

This is an article template you can use as a quick starting point when writing Webiny tutorials. 

Once you've reviewed the template, delete the comments and begin writing your outline or article. 
You'll find some examples of our custom Markdown at the very bottom of the template.

As you write, refer to our technical articles guidelines for more detailed explanations:

- [Webiny technical article guide](https://github.com/webiny/community/article_templates/technical_articles_guide)

Use the stackedit app for [Markdown previewer](https://stackedit.io/app#) to review your article's formatting.

Readers should be able to follow your tutorial from the beginning to the end on Webiny. Before submitting your article pr to the [community](https://github.com/webiny/community) repo, please be sure to create a new Droplet and test your article from start to finish on it exactly as written. 

Cut and paste commands from the article into your terminal to make sure there aren't typos in the commands. If you find yourself executing a command that isn't in the article, incorporate it into the article to make sure the reader gets the exact same results. 

We will test your article and send it back to you if we run into technical problems, which significantly slows down the publication process.

### Structure
Webiny articles have a consistent structure of the following sections:

-   Title
    
-   Introduction
    
-   Goals (Optional)
    
-   Prerequisites

-   Step n - Doing the Last Think
    
-   Conclusion

#### Choose Your Keywords (Req)

You can choose one to five keywords for your article. These keywords will make it easier for readers to discover your articles through search.

The default keywords for Webiny are: `Serverless`, `AWS serverless`, `move to serverless`
